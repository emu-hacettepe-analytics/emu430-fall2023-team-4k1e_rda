# Key Takeaways

-   The project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of crime dynamics in Turkey from 2011 to 2020. Utilizing the dataset "suc turu ve egitim durumuna gore ceza infaz kurumuna giren hukumluler.xls" from TÜİK, the analysis explores the relationships between crime rates, gender, and education levels of offenders. The primary goal is to gain insights into the demographic characteristics of criminals and contribute to the development of effective crime control policies.

-   The primary dataset is obtained from "suc turu ve egitim durumuna gore ceza infaz kurumuna giren hukumluler.xls" from TÜİK, which contains information on people who have been sent to prison. In addition, index data from 2011 to 2020 are used to categorise and analyse crime trends. The dataset is processed using R with packages such as readxl, tidyr and dplyr.

-   An important aspect of this analysis is to consider the gender and educational level of the criminals in order to identify patterns and correlations between these demographic characteristics and crime rates. The R code provided illustrates the detailed steps taken to process the data, including tasks such as cleaning, structuring, handling NAs and preparing the data for visualisation.

-   The analysis produces some interesting results, particularly when looking at crime trends over the period 2011-2020. The plotted data reveals different patterns of crime rates in different categories, with some showing fluctuations and others showing rapid changes, possibly influenced by legal changes or social dynamics. Gender analysis adds depth to the findings, revealing which crimes are more common among certain genders and how these patterns evolve over the years. The use of logarithmic scaling on the y-axis strengthens the visualisation, allowing for the different magnitudes of crime rates and facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the data.

-   The main outcome of this project shows some generalisations about crime. It can be seen that most of the crimes are committed by men (96%), the most common crime is theft (15.7%) and most of the criminals have only secondary school education (29.9%).

### Use and Purchase of Drugs

Between 2011 and 2020, there appears to be a low rate of increase.

Factors such as economic difficulties or unemployment may be the main reason for this increase. Increased social pressures, increased stress levels and life difficulties, lighter sentences may increase drug use.

### Traffic Crimes

The increase in general traffic density with urbanisation and population growth, inadequate urban planning and infrastructure deficiencies are among the reasons for the increase in traffic crimes.

### Threat

Changes in social communication, social media and other communication technologies, police intervention, security policies and criminal sanctions can affect threat offences.

### Theft

While theft crime increased between 2011-2014, it remained almost at the same level between 2014-2020. The increase in theft crimes between 2011-2014 may have led to an increase in security measures during this period. Increased police and improvements in security systems may have reduced theft crimes.

### Swindling

Between 2011 and 2020, an increase rate is observed.

The reason for this increase may be the widespread use of the internet and cyber swindling crimes.

### Smuggling

According to the years, smuggling offences appear to be decreasing and increasing in some years.Economic gains from smuggling activities may affect crime rates.

### Sexual Crimes

While theft crime increased between 2011-2014, it remained almost at the same level between 2014-2020.

The increase in awareness of sexual crimes in the society and the increase in the rate of reporting crimes by victims may increase as crimes are recorded more.

### Robbery

While robbery crimes increased between 2011-2014, they remained almost at the same level between 2014-2020.The economic situation is one of the most important reasons affecting robbery crimes. Factors such as economic insufficiency, unemployment or income inequality can lead to an increase in robbery offences.

### Production and Commerce of Drugs

Drug production and trafficking increased briefly from 2011 onwards and then remained almost at the same level.

Approaches focussing on rehabilitation rather than punishment and changes in criminal justice policies can affect drug trafficking.

# Trend Analysis

In general, when we analyze the total number of crime types over the years, we observe an increasing trend. We can say that the main reason for this is the increase in economic difficulties with the growing population and the gradual change in the social structure. In addition, the fact that data collection and record-keeping are being carried out more with advanced technology than in 2011 allows for more statistical data to be kept on these crime rates. This shows that there is a reason to consider for the increase in the number of crimes.

## Reasons for the Increasing Trend

### Economic Challenges

Economic recession, rising unemployment rates or economic uncertainty can lead to increased crime rates. When people are struggling with financial difficulties, the risk of crime often increases.

### Social Changes

Urbanization, migration movements or changes in the social structure can affect crime rates. Especially in urbanized areas, crime rates often increase.

### Legal and Penal System

Legal reforms, changes in criminal laws or changes in penal enforcement policies can affect crime rates. Harsher penalties or alternative forms of punishment may increase or decrease crime rates.

### Social Support and Rehabilitation Services

Lack of effective social support, rehabilitation and reintegration services can lead to increased crime rates. It is important to reintegrate and support offenders into society.

### Media and Cultural Influences

How the media portrays crimes, perceptions of offenders and social norms can influence crime rates. Media exaggeration of crimes or dissemination of misleading information can lead to an increase in crime rates.

## **Reasons for the Decreasing Trend**

### Effective Police and Security Measures

More effective police work, security measures and crime prevention programs can reduce crime rates.

### Education and Awareness

Awareness and education programs about the negative effects of crime in society can contribute to lower crime rates.

### **Social Assistance and Support Programs**

Economic and social support programs can reduce crime among disadvantaged groups and promote social cohesion.

### **Legal Reforms**

Legal reforms and changes in criminal laws can support offenders' reintegration and return to society.

### **Social Norms and Values**

The attitude of social norms and values towards crime can influence crime rates. Positive social norms and values can contribute to lower crime rates.
