The data is taken from the Turkish Statistical Institute.\n\n\nData Set\nOur Data Set (click to access) consists of crimes committed by criminals who have been judged by the Turkish Penalty and Execution Institution. The number of crimes committed are categorized by years (2011-2020), types of crimes, gender of the criminal and their education status.\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe project focuses on understanding the dynamics of crime rates in Turkey from 2011 to 2020. It examines the relationships between crime rates, gender and education levels of offenders to gain insights into the demographic characteristics of criminals.\nThe primary dataset is obtained from “suc turu ve egitim durumuna gore ceza infaz kurumuna giren hukumluler.xls” from TÜİK, which contains information on people who have been sent to prison. In addition, index data from 2011 to 2020 are used to categorise and analyse crime trends. The dataset is processed using R with packages such as readxl, tidyr and dplyr.\nThe project focuses on the analysis of specific crime categories, including theft, murder and rape, to identify trends in different types of crime over the years. An important aspect of this analysis is to consider the gender and educational level of the criminals in order to identify patterns and correlations between these demographic characteristics and crime rates. The R code provided illustrates the detailed steps taken to process the data, including tasks such as cleaning, structuring, handling NAs and preparing the data for visualisation.\nThe analysis produces some interesting results, particularly when looking at crime trends over the period 2011-2020. The plotted data reveals different patterns of crime rates in different categories, with some showing fluctuations and others showing rapid changes, possibly influenced by legal changes or social dynamics. Gender analysis adds depth to the findings, revealing which crimes are more common among certain genders and how these patterns evolve over the years. The use of logarithmic scaling on the y-axis strengthens the visualisation, allowing for the different magnitudes of crime rates and facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the data.\nThe project aims to contribute to the development of effective crime control policies by providing a detailed understanding of crime dynamics in Turkey. The resulting analyses, including crime trends, gender patterns and correlations with education levels, can inform policy makers and law enforcement agencies. The project output is saved as ‘crime_numbers.RData’ for future reference and analysis. The comprehensive analysis undertaken in this project provides valuable insights that can guide efforts to create a safer society and formulate targeted crime prevention and law enforcement strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

It can be seen that most of the crimes are committed by men (96%), the most common crime is theft (15.7%) and most of the criminals have only secondary school education (29.9%)."

Therefore, understanding changes in crime rates and uncovering the reasons behind these changes form the basis of creating effective crime-fighting strategies.\nThe main reason we chose this data is to understand the social impact by analyzing changes in crime rates and to determine crime profiles by examining the demographic characteristics of criminals. A comprehensive analysis that includes variables such as crime types, gender and education level will contribute to the development of more effective policies in the fight against crime.\nFirst of all, we will examine in detail the changes in the rates of certain types of crimes. We aim to obtain a more detailed output about the security situation of the society by analyzing trends in crime categories such as theft, murder and rape.\nGender and education level are important factors in understanding the crime profile. Our study will focus on the relationships between gender and education levels of offenders and, in this context, will help us better understand the sensitivity of crime to demographic characteristics. The types of analysis aimed in the project consist of determining which crime types are more common in which year using Descriptive Statistics, observing which crime types a certain gender is more prone to and how their trends change over the year with Gender-Based Analysis, observing how the number of crime types changes over time with Time-Series Analysis, analyzing how a certain crime type depends on factors such as gender and year with Regression Analysis.\nThe resulting analyzes can contribute to efforts to create a safer society by providing information on identifying the factors underlying crime."

The x axis is years for each type of crime and y axis is the number of times that crime was committed, of course. The plot piece named “Total” is the total amount of times all crimes were committed.\nSome of the crimes start or end abruptly as there are types of crimes redacted or added throughout the years such as “Opposition to cheque laws” which was only judged in 2011 and 2012.\nY axis of our plot is logarithmically scaled to compensate for the difference between the total number of times all the crimes for committed (Total) and the number of times different types of crimes were committed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nHelp from ChatGPT has been used to cut back from time googling very specific data formatting problems.

Using readxl to access the data from its excel file format, and rest to process the exported data chunk by chunk so we could rid the data from its NA filled, unplottable structure.\nSome ways the data is categorized can be seen by looking into this plot:\n\nDon’t be shy to open the image in a new tab so you can zoom in on it!\nSo, as it can be seen from the plot, the types of crimes that are present in the data are given as the titles of the individual line plots. The x axis is years for each type of crime and y axis is the number of times that crime was committed, of course. The plot piece named “Total” is the total amount of times all crimes were committed.\nSome of the crimes start or end abruptly as there are types of crimes redacted or added throughout the years such as “Opposition to cheque laws” which was only judged in 2011 and 2012.\nY axis of our plot is logarithmically scaled to compensate for the difference between the total number of times all the crimes for committed (Total) and the number of times different types of crimes were committed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nHelp from ChatGPT has been used to cut back from time googling very specific data formatting problems. More context can be provided if needed."

    "text": "Our project will focus on the relationships between the gender and education levels of those who committed crimes in Turkey between 2011 and 2020, and in this context, it aims to help us better understand the sensitivity of crime to population-related characteristics.\nCrime is a complex issue that affects the order and security of societies. Therefore, understanding changes in crime rates and uncovering the reasons behind these changes form the basis of creating effective crime-fighting strategies.\nThe main reason we chose this data is to understand the social impact by analyzing changes in crime rates and to determine crime profiles by examining the demographic characteristics of criminals. A comprehensive analysis that includes variables such as crime types, gender and education level will contribute to the development of more effective policies in the fight against crime.\nFirst of all, we will examine in detail the changes in the rates of certain types of crimes. We aim to obtain a more detailed output about the security situation of the society by analyzing trends in crime categories such as theft, murder and rape.\nGender and education level are important factors in understanding the crime profile. Our study will focus on the relationships between gender and education levels of offenders and, in this context, will help us better understand the sensitivity of crime to demographic characteristics. The types of analysis aimed in the project consist of determining which crime types are more common in which year using Descriptive Statistics, observing which crime types a certain gender is more prone to and how their trends change over the year with Gender-Based Analysis, observing how the number of crime types changes over time with Time-Series Analysis, analyzing how a certain crime type depends on factors such as gender and year with Regression Analysis.\nThe resulting analyzes can contribute to efforts to create a safer society by providing information on identifying the factors underlying crime."

    "text": "Reasons for the Increasing Trend\n\nEconomic Challenges\nEconomic recession, rising unemployment rates or economic uncertainty can lead to increased crime rates. When people are struggling with financial difficulties, the risk of crime often increases.\n\n\nSocial Changes\nUrbanization, migration movements or changes in the social structure can affect crime rates. Especially in urbanized areas, crime rates often increase.\n\n\nLegal and Penal System\nLegal reforms, changes in criminal laws or changes in penal enforcement policies can affect crime rates. Harsher penalties or alternative forms of punishment may increase or decrease crime rates.\n\n\nSocial Support and Rehabilitation Services\nLack of effective social support, rehabilitation and reintegration services can lead to increased crime rates. It is important to reintegrate and support offenders into society.\n\n\nMedia and Cultural Influences\nHow the media portrays crimes, perceptions of offenders and social norms can influence crime rates. Media exaggeration of crimes or dissemination of misleading information can lead to an increase in crime rates."
